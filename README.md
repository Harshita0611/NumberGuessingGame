# NumberGuessingGame
A number guessing game is a simple yet engaging game in which a player attempts to guess a randomly selected number within a specified range. Here's a short description of the game and the procedure to play:

**Description:**
In a number guessing game, a computer or another player thinks of a secret number within a defined range (e.g., between 1 and 100), and the player's objective is to guess that number correctly within a limited number of attempts. The game typically provides hints or feedback to help the player make more accurate guesses.

**Procedure to Play:**
1. **Setup:**
   - Define the range of numbers (e.g., 1 to 100) within which the secret number will be selected.
   - Decide on the maximum number of attempts allowed.

2. **Select the Secret Number:**
   - The game host (computer or another player) selects a random number within the defined range and keeps it secret.

3. **Player's Turn:**
   - The player starts by making their first guess, choosing a number within the defined range.

4. **Feedback:**
   - The game host provides feedback to the player. Common feedback includes:
     - "Too high" if the guess is higher than the secret number.
     - "Too low" if the guess is lower than the secret number.
     - "Correct" if the guess matches the secret number.

5. **Repeat:**
   - The player continues to make guesses based on the feedback provided.
   - They aim to narrow down their guesses, taking into account the feedback to get closer to the secret number.

6. **Winning:**
   - The player wins the game by guessing the correct number within the allowed number of attempts.

7. **Ending the Game:**
   - If the player exceeds the allowed attempts without guessing correctly, the game ends, and they can choose to start a new game.

The number guessing game is a fun way to challenge your problem-solving skills and intuition. It can be customized with different variations, such as changing the range, adding time limits, or incorporating more complex feedback rules.
